  <!--  Event Bubbling and Capturting aka trikkling  -->
  <!--  Event bubbling and capturing are way to propogate events in the DOM tree. They both have there 
        own behaviours. When we clicked on the child event it propogates to the parent and go on until 
        root.Event capturing is its opposite of bubbling.
