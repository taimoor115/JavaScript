## `null` is considered a primitive value in JavaScript.

- As a primitive value, `null` is not an object and does not have properties or methods of its own.
- It is used to represent the intentional absence of any object value.
- When a variable is assigned `null`, it means that the variable does not currently refer to any object or value.

- foreach is great because it is shorter syntax but it has some limitation like we can not use the break and continue statement in the foreach but we can use in the for in and for of loop
