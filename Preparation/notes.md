## `null` is considered a primitive value in JavaScript.

- As a primitive value, `null` is not an object and does not have properties or methods of its own.
- It is used to represent the intentional absence of any object value.
- When a variable is assigned `null`, it means that the variable does not currently refer to any object or value.
