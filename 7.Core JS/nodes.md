Call: In JavaScript, the call() method is used to invoke a function with a specified this context and arguments provided individually. It allows you to explicitly set what this refers to within the function when it is executed

Apply: Similarly, the apply() method is used to invoke a function with a specified this context and arguments provided as an array or an array-like object. Like call(), it allows you to explicitly set the this value within the function. 


Bind:The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to a specific value, and with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called. It allows you to create a new function with a preset context (this) and optionally some initial arguments.
